[Secretaribot](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Secretaribot) is actually a few (quite small) python scripts, which, along with [Noisebot](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebot), help out the Noisebridge collective with housekeeping tasks.

The canonical version of the README can be found on Noisebridge's sprawling wiki at https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Secretaribot
